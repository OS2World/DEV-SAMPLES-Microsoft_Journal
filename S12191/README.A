This is an example of using MS OS/2 queues from BASIC. In this 
example, a single BASIC process (running in one OS/2 screen group) 
creates a queue, writes information to the queue, and reads 
information back from the queue. The example uses the following MS 
OS/2 API calls:

   DosCreateQueue
   DosReadQueue
   DosWriteQueue
   DosQueryQueue
   DosCloseQueue
   DosPeekQueue
   DosPurgeQueue
   DosAllocShrSeg
   DosGetShrSeg

This information applies to Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and
6.00b for MS OS/2, and to Microsoft BASIC Professional Development 
System (PDS) Version 7.00 for MS OS/2. (This information does not 
apply to Microsoft QuickBASIC, which supports only the MS-DOS 
operating system.)

More Information:

The following files make up this example:

1. Q3.BAS - A program that creates/reads a Queue

2. QUEUE.BI - An include file used by Q3.BAS

3. UTIL.BAS - BASIC routines to read/write shared memory

4. README.A - Text file describing how to compile, link, and run this 
              example (as shown below).

The compile and LINK instructions are as follows:

1.  BC q3;

2.  BC util /x;

3.  LINK q3 util;

Now you can run Q3.EXE.
