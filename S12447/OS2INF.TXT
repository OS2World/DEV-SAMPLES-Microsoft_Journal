Usenet comp.os.os2 Newsgroup
----------------------------

The unmoderated Usenet newsgroup comp.os.os2 is a general forum for
all OS/2-related questions on the OS/2 operating system. Messages in
this newsgroup are NOT gatewayed into the "OS/2 Discussion Forum" OS/2
internet digest.

OS/2 Discussion Forum Internet Digest
-------------------------------------

The "OS/2 Discussion Forum" is an internet OS/2-specific digest that
is unrelated (i.e., not gatewayed) to the OS/2 comp.os.os2 newsgroup.
This moderated digest originates from the K.U.Leuven (Catholic
University of Louvain) in Belgium, and currently has approximately 450
subscribers and 14 local redistribution aliases. There is no charge to
receive the digest or access the files it makes available. The digest
is based on a list server. The domain and bitnet paths to the digest's
list server and moderator are as follows:

   listserv:    listserv@blekul11.bitnet      (bitnet)
                listserv@cc1.kuleuven.ac.be   (domain)
   submissions: os-2@blekul11.bitnet          (bitnet)
                os-2@cc1.kuleuven.ac.be       (domain)
   moderator:   tewos-2@blekul14.bitnet       (bitnet)
                tewos-2@liris.kuleuven.ac.be  (domain)

If you have BITNET access, you can interactively access the list
server using the standard listserv virtual machine commands (such as
the VM TELL command). If you are not on BITNET, you can use email to
talk to it, with the listserv command as the message body. To obtain
back issues from the listserv at blekul11 (see addresses above), use
the following message:

   get os-2 logYYMM

where YYMM is the name of the log (for example, "get os-2 log8905").
Valid values of YYMM currently are 8905, 8906, 8907, 8908, 8909, and
8910. To subscribe to the digest, use the following message

   subscribe os-2 YOUR FULL NAME

where YOUR FULL NAME is your full name (for example, "sub os-2 John
Doe"). To get a current list of the files available in the OS/2 file
archives, use the following message:

   index os-2

To get a file list with additional comments, use the following
message:

   get os-2 filelist

To retrieve a file, use the following message:

   get os-2 NAME EXTENSION

where NAME is the filename and EXTENSION is the file extension. For
example, use "get os-2 arc2 exe" to get the file ARC2.EXE; note that
there is no period between the filename and the file extension. To get
a list of subscribers, use the following message:

   review os-2

The policy for submitting new OS/2 files is that the author should
approve being placed on the digest's list server. For more information
on this subject, contact the digest moderator. To get general listserv
help, use the following message:

   help

ISO8859 Internet Mailing List
-----------------------------

"ISO8859" is an internet listserv-based mailing list that specializes
in working with character sets; its subtitle is "ASCII/EBCDIC
Character Set Related Issues." Although its name implies that this is
only for the ISO 8859/[1-8] character sets, there is a large amount of
discussion on the ASCII and EBCDIC codepages of MS-DOS, OS/2, and
other IBM platforms. Thus, although this mailing list is not OS/2
specific, it is beneficial to OS/2 developers who write applications
that support multiple codepages.

Once you have used one listserv, the rest basically work in the same
manner. The listserv instructions listed above for the OS/2 Discussion
Forum also apply to this listserv-based mailing list, except that the
list name is ISO8859 rather than OS/2. The list is based on the
listserv at JHUVM. Thus, the addresses for the listserver are as
follows:

   listserv:     listserv.jhuvm.bitnet (bitnet)
   submissions:  iso8859@.jhuvm.bitnet (bitnet)

OS/2 Application Guide
----------------------

IBM and Microsoft produce the "OS/2 Application Guide," which is
distributed free of charge from IBM. This 5.5 x 8.5 x 1 inch paperback
lists hundreds of OS/2 applications that are available (or are
scheduled to be available). This guide provides free advertising for
developers, and a good collection of information for consumers. To
obtain a copy of the "OS/2 Application Guide," call (800) 426-2468,
extension 120.

An ASCII copy of this archive is available in the Microsoft OnLine
Software/Data Library in a file named OS2APPS. This file is also on
CompuServe and other information systems. OS2APPS can be found in the
Software/Data Library by searching on the keyword OS2APPS, the Q
number of this article, or S12020. OS2APPS was archived using the
PKware file-compression utility.

A form of this application guide is available as an on-line database
from the IBM National Support Center BBS (Bulletin Board Service) in
Atlanta, Georgia; the data line is (404) 988-2913. You can scan or
search this database, which has products listed by category as well as
alphabetically, and cross-referenced by company. The "OS/2 Application
Guide" is also available on-line on another IBM BBS, with the data
line (404) 988-2790.

According to the IBM Personal Systems Developer publication,
developers that want to place their product in this guide should call
IBM at (407) 982-9614 and request an OS/2 application form. According
to the IBM National Support Center BBS, developers that want to
request an enrollment form to place a software listing in the "OS/2
Compatibility Guide" on-line database should write to the following
address:

   Ms. Mildred N. Sanderson
   IBM Corporation - 1709
   P.O. Box 1328
   Boca Raton, FL.
   33429 - 1328
   USA

According to the title page of the "OS/2 Application Guide," to apply

Application Guide" is derived), submit a written request to the
following address:

   IBM Corporation
   AG-ZIP 4607
   P.O. Box 1328
   Boca Raton, FL 33429-1328


Microsoft OnLine
----------------

The Microsoft OnLine support system is a fee support service that
provides developer support for OS/2 (in addition to providing support
for other environments and products). Microsoft OnLine contains a very
large database of information for OS/2 developers. There are also many
sample applications and updated versions of some OS/2 system files
(new video drivers, etc.). For more information on Microsoft OnLine,
call (800) 443-4672.


Microsoft University
--------------------

Microsoft University (MU) is a training center that offers courses on
OS/2 for users and developers. There are OS/2 support, base (non-PM)
programming, PM programming, device driver programming, SQL Server,
and LAN Manager courses (in addition to Windows and other non-OS/2
courses). Their main branch is in Bellevue, Washington, but there are
other sites in Boston, Massachusetts and Washington, D.C.

Special arrangements can be made to hold seminars at your company. In
addition, courses are licensed by other companies (such as Intel). For

There are many information fee-based systems that have conferences on
OS/2.

CompuServe has the PCMAGNET (PC Magazine) forum and the Microsoft
Systems Forum MSSYS (GO MSSYS). In the MSSYS forum, Section 8 is for
OS/2 issues and Section 9 is for Presentation Manager issues. Another
Microsoft forum on CompuServe is the Microsoft Knowledge Base (GO
MSKB), which contains about 15,000 articles on Microsoft products and
the Software Library (GO MSL) containing official Microsoft files
(drivers, MSJ source code, etc.) available for downloading.

There are other systems as well. BIX has the ibm.os2 conference, and
other information systems, such as GEnie, Prodigy, etc., all have
similar forums.

---------------------------

One anonymous FTP site that contains OS/2 files is the site
mtsg.ubc.ca (128.189.103.1); move into the OS/2 subdirectory after
logging in: "cd os2".

The SIMTEL20 archive contains some OS/2 files. The only OS/2-specific
subdirectory of the site simtel20.army.mil is the "PD:<MSDOS.OS2>".
