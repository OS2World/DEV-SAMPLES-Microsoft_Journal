				FULLSCRN

			       August 1990

    This sample shows a method to guarantee that an application will
return to the full screen group that started it. Most applications do
this by default, but applications based on dialog boxes or message
boxes may not return.

    The sample FULLSCRN just creates a dummy frame window so that the
normal switching code is activated.
